By Audrey Njiraini

## Overall Project Description
If you are like me, You really don’t know what is happening in your neighborhood most of the time. What if an important meeting happens, theft or even death wouldn’t you like to know about it.

This is a web application that allows you to be in the loop about everything happening in your neighborhood. From contact information of different handyman to meeting announcements or even alerts.

## User stories

    <li>A user must sign in with the application to start using.</li>
    <li>A user can set up a profile about them and a general location and their neighborhood name. </li>
    <li>A user can find a list of different businesses in their neighborhood.</li>
    <li>A user can find contact information for the health department and Police authorities near their neighborhood.</li>
    <li>A user can create posts that will be visible to everyone in their neighborhood.</li>
